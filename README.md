## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Not much, was pretty frustrating towards the end. I guess I understand flexbox properties a bit better. 

### Continued development

Plan to do more static pages to learn how to better position things on a webpag
